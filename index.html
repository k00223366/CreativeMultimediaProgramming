        <h2>The Frauenkirche Dresden</h2>

            <p>This church was completed in 1743. The dome is 96 meters high. It is made of sandstone and weighs 12,000 tonnes.</p>
            
            <p>George Baehr who was the city architect won the commission. The church would be a square building with a dome. </p>
                
            <p>He wanted the Frauenkirche to be 'like a single stone from the ground to its highest point'.</p>
            
            <p> There had always been worries over the dome. However during the seven years war over one hundred cannon balls hit it without causing major damage.</p>
            
            <h3> The church's destruction.</h3>
            <p>
                One of the largest bombing raids of the second world war happened in Dresden in February 1945.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conditions were so castastrophic that fire storms swept the area. Fifteen square kilometers was erased. Yet the church survived the bombing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However the inside had caught fire and turned the building into an oven. The sandstone could not cope with the extreme condtions. The dome fell to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ruins lay there for four decades. Dresden lay behind the iron curtain. The government was not interested in rebuilding a church. People prevented the city removing the rubble. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1960's the city council declared the ruins a memorial against war.

                    This site is a project to test search engine optimisation based on the keywords of 'Creative Multimedia Programming'.     
                </p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>
                    The engineering and artistry displayed by the renovation of this church allows an opportunity to test this. The project has one of the best websites I've ever seen. It details the people and groups involved in the reconstruction. It shows us the engineers, carpenters, carvers, painters, stonemasons, the myriad of people needed to bring the task to fruition. 
                
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The site itself uses beautiful animations, photographs and extensive audio clips to describe the people and the work they undertook.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The site used to be hosted by ZDF, Germany's private television company. I regard this site as state of the art when it comes to using a multimedia platform to educate, entertain and impress an audience about a cultural artefact.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    The restoration took many years to complete but the result is magnificent and beautiful.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The quality of the cut stone floor, to the beautiful wooden pews, the effect is to promote a golden light and airy interior.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    It is the state of the art in baroque design, a high point of architecture.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The site is accompanied by a wonderful orchestral piece of music. It is so unusual for a website to get so many different things right. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    How they approach the story of the church, its destruction and renovation. Mixing the religious and engineering and artistry of so many disciplines. Then bringing all the strands together and making them chime as one.
