            <p>This church was completed in 1743. The dome is 96 meters high. It is made of sandstone and weighs 12,000 tonnes.</p>
            
            <p>George Baehr who was the city architect won the commission. The church would be a square building with a dome. </p>
                
            <p>He wanted the Frauenkirche to be 'like a single stone from the ground to its highest point'.</p>
            
            <p> There had always been worries over the dome. However during the seven years war over one hundred cannon balls hit it without causing major damage.</p>
            
            <h3> The church's destruction.</h3>
            <p>
                One of the largest bombing raids of the second world war happened in Dresden in February 1945.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conditions were so castastrophic that fire storms swept the area. Fifteen square kilometers was erased. Yet the church survived the bombing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However the inside had caught fire and turned the building into an oven. The sandstone could not cope with the extreme condtions. The dome fell to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ruins lay there for four decades. Dresden lay behind the iron curtain. The government was not interested in rebuilding a church. People prevented the city removing the rubble. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1960's the city council declared the ruins a memorial against war.
